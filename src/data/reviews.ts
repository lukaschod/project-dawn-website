There should be an indication on the Unity asset store that the asset references obsolete method groups. However, through the excellent support by Unity Support Team who put me in contact with the Developer all concerns have vanished. The Developer quickly responded and I have full confidence in the support of this asset. Highly recommended...BUY NOW and support this awesome asset.",

This blows the built-in navigation system out of the water and can support 100's of agents navigating at once without crushing your fps. My only issue would be with the editor documentation.

        text: "The asset is high performant solution for even complex RTS strategy games, similar to wacraft/starcraft, and solves issues even the A* does not. More Detailed Review: Remarks We use this asset for our game, Darfall (rts city builder). As we are now under the Paradox publisher, you can imagine the AI is a core component of our systems and needs to be fast and reliable. The Good - Very performant solution, based on ECS. - Good agent obstacle functionality with numerous settings. - Works with A* pathfinding and NavMesh, which does not require you to rework your entire game if you use this asset (however, we encountered some errors with A* integration at first) - The creator even scheduled a support call with us, which was a very positive sign. - we requested 2 new critical features, even though it took some time, both we eventually adde, which allowed us to continue using the asset for project - I have seen the code, its quite clean and adheres to coding standards, no spaghetti, which is rare case these days Some Hiccups - to be fair, some support was a bit late, or answers on discord took several weeks to get a response. All issues were eventually solved, but this could be improved in the future. - there are some rare cases where agents won't stop and try to get to destination blocked by other agents forever, while components meant to prevent this cannot solve it, as its quite a rare case, however its possible to introduce your own component that can prevent this quite easily Summary If you have a complex RTS with cities, procedurally generated maps, or many units that need very tailored avoidance behavior and you need your units to be snappy, this asset is a must. For us, the A* just did not solve these issues. This solution has just insane performance, much better than A* from our long experience.",

        text: "Imposter Graph integrates so cleanly into Unity, it feels like it was made by Unity themselves. Hardly surprising, as the author apparently worked in the Unity URP team. I played around with the graph portion of this asset a bit. It's relatively easy to follow along, it's generating temporary textures and combines them to a few final textures. I was able to make a graph that captures emission into my imposters in less than an hour. For basic needs, I think the two included graphs will work without flaw for most. They seem to create more accurate renders than Amplify. The asset works perfect in Unity 2022.3. I think this asset does everything that Amplify is trying to do but with a cleaner, tighter workflow. The documentation is admittedly a bit sparse, but the learning curve is as close to non-existent as I can imagine for turning something into an imposter. If you have an prefab that uses more advanced shaders/materials, more in-depth documentation or video tutorials of how to leverage the graphing portion would likely be a great value add. Great support from the developer on his Discord, he is active and answered my questions. 5 star, I can recommend this unconditionally. Great for any moderately to large scaled 3D project as a great performance booster.",

With that in mind I made my own grid/tile based system which used A* and a bunch of tasks to create a relatively good pathfinding system. The local avoidance was.... not so good? It was a mess, with characters taking long routes, and still walking through one another! I jumped on this asset as it was on sale, and honestly I now would pay full price now I know how easy it is to set up and use, and just how robust it is! The results are perfect, and the performance is unholy - I couldn't tell I had 100 units on screen in terms of performance. :) The developer answered the only setup question I had, and did so incredibly promptly (on a weekend!) and with all the patience in the world. I can't recommend this asset enough - the documentation is there, the discord is a wonderful direct way to ask questions, nothing could be better. All assets should be this calibre. :) Update (18-04-23) Still going strong! My game is miles ahead thanks to this asset. It's about the same experience as the Unity NavMesh, but... the system that's here is so much smarter at local avoidance. :) It's a treat to use, and my game is lightyears ahead thanks to this asset, so much so I'm coming back to re-iterate it!",
